/*
Use .env to set your store name
Connect to the CAPS server
Every 5 seconds, simulate a new customer order
  Create an order object with your store name, order id, customer name, address
    HINT: Have some fun by using the faker library to make up phony information
  Create a message object with the following keys:
    event - ‘pickup’
    payload - the order object you created in the above step
  Write that message (as a string) to the CAPS server
Listen for the data event coming in from the CAPS server
  When data arrives, parse it (it should be JSON) and look for the event property
  If the event is called delivered
    Log “thank you for delivering id” to the console
  Ignore any data that specifies a different event
